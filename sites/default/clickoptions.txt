# CLICKOPTIONS by Mark Leeds
# This is a new addition to OpenEMR written in April of 2005.
# The purpose is to minimize typing in places where a select box or drop down menu
# would be helpful.  For now it is implemented in the medical history section that
# is reached if you are looking at a patient chart and click 'Summary' at the top
# of the screen and then click 'more' next to 'Medical Problems' below.  You will see
# five sets of boxes where you can edit medical problems, medications, allergies, surgeries,
# and immunizations.  If this file that you are reading now is set up properly, you will see
# below each category heading a select box that allows you to click and select from a few
# text options that will immediately appear in the box below (javascript must be active of course).
# The format for this file is that any line starting with a '#' is a comment.
# Categories and choices for the select boxes are entered with a '::' separating them. see
# below for example.  You may add more choices, change them or do away with them alltogether.
# If a category has no choices assigned in this file, the select box will not appear.
# The files that had to be altered for this feature to work are in openemr/interface/patient_file/summary.
# Three statements were added to 5 files marked with a clickoptions comment and two files were added
# to the directory, 'clickoptions1.php' and 'clickoptions2.php'.
